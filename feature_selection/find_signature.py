### the words (features) and authors (labels), already largely processed
words_file = "../text_learning/your_word_data.pkl" ### like the file you made in the last mini-project 
authors_file = "../text_learning/your_email_authors.pkl"  ### this too
word_data = pickle.load( open(words_file, "r"))
authors = pickle.load( open(authors_file, "r") )



### test_size is the percentage of events assigned to the test set (remainder go into training)
from sklearn import cross_validation
features_train, features_test, labels_train, labels_test = cross_validation.train_test_split(word_data, authors, test_size=0.1, random_state=42)


from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(sublinear_tf=True, max_df=0.5,
                             stop_words='english')
features_train = vectorizer.fit_transform(features_train).toarray()
features_test  = vectorizer.transform(features_test).toarray()


### a classic way to overfit is to use a small number
### of data points and a large number of features
### train on only 150 events to put ourselves in this regime
features_train = features_train[:150]
labels_train   = labels_train[:150]



### your code goes here
from sklearn import tree
clf = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier()
clf.fit(features_train, labels_train)
feature_importances = clf.feature_importances_

print 'number of labels', len(labels_train)
print 'accuracy: ', clf.score(features_test, labels_test)
print 'feature importances: ', feature_importances
most_important_relative_features = filter(lambda x: x > 0.2, feature_importances)
print 'most_important_relative_features', most_important_relative_features
index = numpy.where(feature_importances == most_important_relative_features[0] )[0][0]
print 'index of most important relative feature', index
print 'The most important word is... ', vectorizer.get_feature_names()[index]
